This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I'm a self taught enthusiast. I began my journey as techy young, in the early years i began to play pc games. i fell in love with strategy based games before eventually moving onto figuring out hardware. i was always inclined to learn deeper than what was readily available through resources around me. just being a regular tech user and small interests in DPT kept me at a certain level in my readings. I finally made the decision to go into coding a bit further when i discovered blockchain. i took my first dive into the documentation of Ethereum and it caught fire in my mind very fast. i was reluctant to even learn programming before but this changed my entire mind on the subject, but it was paired with my first years at collect studying computer engineering. i loved math growing up. it never gave me the feeling of work when i was crunching numbers or working with equations/formulas. i began to see that i could apply all the thing i enjoyed in life into one domain. i was late by years but i soon jumped into the race and began to start my journey or 'catching' up. the last fives years i have read hundred and hundreds of chapters in text books, and other collective works of programmers. so i am here now to end my cram sessions and obsessive nature for reading before working. i am rolling my sleeves up and getting my hands dirty with projects. welcome to the journey.
